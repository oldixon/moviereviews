<h2>Probably one of the best movies of it's category if not the best. del Toro iz amazing director and you clearly can see how much heart and brain he puts into his movies. Engaging story, hero journey is top of the tops, lovable characters, well developed characters, crazy action that tries to simulate real life physics as much as tech allows it... Pacific Rim, Starship Troopers and Aliens 2 are movies that I just can't stop watching over and over again.</h2>
